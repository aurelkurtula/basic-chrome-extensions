Exploring the basics of chrome extensions.

**extensionOne_conCrastinator** is a very basic example of how an extension can be used to manipulate the contents of a website. A step by step tutorial of how I created this can be found at [dev.to](https://dev.to/aurelkurtula/basics-of-chrome-extensions-development-part-one-24h). The end result being replacing twitter and facebook with a page that looks like this:

**extensionTwo_snipDa** is another basic example of how to develop a pop-up extension. As a minimal replica of evernote's web clipper, with this extention we are able to select some content on any page we visit and have it displayed on our extension form. A tutoria explaining how this can be achieved can be found [here](https://dev.to/aurelkurtula/basics-of-chrome-extensions-development-part-two-82p). The end result looking like this:
